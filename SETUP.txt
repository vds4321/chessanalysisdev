CHESS.COM COACH - QUICK SETUP
====================================

Step 1: Open the file called ".env.example" in this folder

Step 2: Change these two lines:

   CHESS_COM_USERNAME=your_chess_com_username
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=

   Replace "your_chess_com_username" with YOUR Chess.com username.
   For example, if your Chess.com profile is chess.com/member/john123
   then change it to: CHESS_COM_USERNAME=john123

   (The API key is optional - leave it blank if you don't have one)

Step 3: Save the file as ".env" (remove the ".example" part)

   On Mac: File > Save As > name it ".env"
   On Windows: File > Save As > name it ".env" (with quotes)

Step 4: You're done! Run the analysis notebook.
